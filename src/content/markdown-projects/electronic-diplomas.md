title: Electronic Diplomas
path: '/projects/diplomas'
summary: <p>As a result of COVID-19, many CSUMB students encountered delays in receiving their physical diplomas. Offering electronic diplomas was the campus' solution to this issue. </p><p>I created an informational landing page, and a credential validation page. Within the landing page, I encrypted an SSO hyperlink using NodeJS, allowing students to arrive at the diploma vendor's website logged in. The credential validation page allows anyone to verify the authenticity of a credential via an API call to the vendor using React and Javascript.</p>
